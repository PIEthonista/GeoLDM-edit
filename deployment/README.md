### Math Equations

To understand the model’s output, we use the following equations:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

This is Einstein’s famous equation for energy-mass equivalence.

More complex equations can also be represented like so:

$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} $$

Where:
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field
- $\rho$ is the charge density
- $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

This sentence uses delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

Feel free to adjust the inputs and generate results based on your needs.
