'Species' referred in this paper is are the atom types (H,C,N,O,F). Simply put, 
the authors wanna make sure that in the train-test-val split, all atom types listed above
must at least appear once in each split. How to know, refer:
/GeoLDM-edit/qm9/data/utils.py, line 137, def _get_species

train-test torch.dataset:
/GeoLDM-edit/qm9/data/dataset_class.py

hydrogen is not used in the one-hot encoding of atom charges/types, see 
/GeoLDM-edit/qm9/data/dataset_class.py, line 47
    included_species = torch.unique(self.data['charges'], sorted=True)
    if included_species[0] == 0:   # remove H
        included_species = included_species[1:]

one-hot encoding of non-H atoms, see:
/GeoLDM-edit/qm9/data/dataset_class.py, line 62

dataset return, see:
/GeoLDM-edit/qm9/data/dataset_class.py, line 109, def __getitem__
# returned shape {'charges': [max_molecule_num_atoms=29, HCNOF=5],
#                 'positions': [max_molecule_num_atoms=29, xyz=3],
#                  ...
#                 }

number of datapoints / rows used for each train-test-val split is controlled in the below, generated during the download of qm9 dataset.
optional, to reset this split, regenerate train-test-split precomputed-presplit datafiles.npz by setting force_download=True in prepare_dataset().
