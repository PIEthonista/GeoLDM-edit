'Species' referred in this paper is are the atom types (H,C,N,O,F). Simply put, 
the authors wanna make sure that in the train-test-val split, all atom types listed above
must at least appear once in each split. How to know, refer:

hydrogen is not used in the one-hot encoding of atom charges/types, see
